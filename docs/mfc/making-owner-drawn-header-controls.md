# Making Owner-Drawn Header Controls

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

You can define individual items of a header control ([CHeaderCtrl](reference/cheaderctrl-class.md)) to be owner-drawn items. For more information, see [Owner-Drawn Header Controls](/windows/win32/Controls/header-controls) in the Windows SDK.
