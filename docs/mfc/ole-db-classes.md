# OLE DB Classes

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

The OLE DB support in MFC currently consists of the class [COLEDBRecordView](reference/coledbrecordview-class.md). `COleDBRecordView` displays database records in controls, through a form view directly connected to a [CRowset](../data/oledb/crowset-class.md) object. For more information about the OLE DB consumer templates, see [List of OLE DB Consumer Templates](../data/oledb/ole-db-consumer-templates-reference.md).
