# TN037: Multithreaded MFC 2.1 Applications

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

This technical note originally described the limitations of multithreaded programs with MFC 2.1, originally provided with Visual C++ 1.0 for Windows NT. MFC 3.0 supports multithreading directly and is documented. See that reference for more information.
