# Orchestrating Other Window Actions

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

The frame window orchestrates semimodal states such as context-sensitive help and print preview. For a description of the frame window's role in print preview, see [Printing and Print Preview](printing-and-print-preview.md).
