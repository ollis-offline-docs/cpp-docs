# Internet and Networking Classes

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

These classes allow you to exchange information with another computer using a Windows Socket or Win32 Internet (WinInet). There are also a set of classes for manipulating Windows Sockets.

The following categories of classes support connectivity.

- [Windows Sockets Classes](windows-sockets-classes.md)

- [Win32 Internet Classes](win32-internet-classes.md)
