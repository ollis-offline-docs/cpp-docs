# Responding to Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

The frame window can respond to dynamic data exchange (DDE) requests to open files from the File Manager (if the file extension is registered or associated with the application). See [Shell Registration](../mfc/special-cwinapp-services.md).
