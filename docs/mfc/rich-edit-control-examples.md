# Rich Edit Control Examples

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

The MFC OLE sample [WORDPAD](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/da802c2aa92a730b3da33c5957186f128709c398/VC2010Samples/MFC/Visual%20C%2B%2B%202008%20Feature%20Pack/WordPad) uses the `CRichEditView`, `CRichEditDoc`, and `CRichEditCntrItem` classes. By extension, it uses the [CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md). For a quick description of these three classes, see [Classes Related to Rich Edit Controls](../mfc/classes-related-to-rich-edit-controls.md).
