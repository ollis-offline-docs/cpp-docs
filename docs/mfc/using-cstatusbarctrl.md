# Using CStatusBarCtrl

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

You can use the status bar control ([CStatusBarCtrl](../mfc/reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md)) to create a control window that reflects various kinds of status information about the application. The status window can be divided into parts that display more than one type of information.
