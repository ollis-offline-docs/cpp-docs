# Date and Time Picker Control Examples

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

The [CMNCTRL1](../overview/visual-cpp-samples.md) sample demonstrates the various attributes of the `CDateTimeCtrl` class. A separate page contains a date and time picker control that the user can manipulate by changing various attributes and testing the basic functionality of the control.
