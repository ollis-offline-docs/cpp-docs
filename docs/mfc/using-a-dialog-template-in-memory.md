# Using a Dialog Template in Memory

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

Instead of using the methods given in the [Dialog Creation table](../mfc/creating-a-dialog-class-with-code-wizards.md), you can create either kind of dialog box indirectly from a dialog template in memory. For more information, see class [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md) in the *MFC Reference*.
