# Adding an MFC Class

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

To add classes derived from Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library classes to your project, use the **Add Class** button in [Class Wizard](mfc-class-wizard.md). Specify the name of the new class, select the base class, and select the ID of the dialog box with which it is associated (if any). The wizard creates a header file and an implementation file and adds them to your project.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add MFC classes to an ATL COM application if you initially [created the application with MFC support](../../atl/reference/mfc-support-in-atl-projects.md). You can also add MFC classes to Win32 projects that have MFC support.

### To add an MFC class to your project

From Class View, right-click the project name. Click **Class Wizard** and then click **Add Class** to open the [Add MFC Class](mfc-add-class-wizard.md) dialog box. Use **Class Wizard** to add message handlers or new methods.
