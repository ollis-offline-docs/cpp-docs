# Manipulating Menus During Program Execution

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

Use class `CMenu` to manipulate menus and menu items on the fly. `CMenu` encapsulates a Windows HMENU handle and supplies member functions for working with menus.

See the overview for class [CMenu](reference/cmenu-class.md) for details.
