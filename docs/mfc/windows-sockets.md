# Windows Sockets

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

This family of articles covers the MFC implementation of Windows Sockets. MFC supplies two classes to support programming network applications with the Windows Sockets API. Class [CAsyncSocket](../mfc/reference/casyncsocket-class.md) encapsulates the Windows Sockets API one for one, giving advanced network programmers the most power and flexibility. Class [CSocket](../mfc/reference/csocket-class.md) provides a simplified interface for serializing data to and from a [CArchive](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md) object.
