# TN036: Using CFormView with AppWizard and ClassWizard

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

This technical note described how to modify an AppWizard generated application so that it used a `CFormView` instead of the default `CView` as its main view class. This is supported directly with this version of Visual C++.
