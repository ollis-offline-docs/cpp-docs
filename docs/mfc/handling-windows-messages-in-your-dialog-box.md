# Handling Windows Messages in Your Dialog Box

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

Dialog boxes are windows, so they can handle Windows messages if you supply the appropriate handler functions. When you create your dialog class with the [Class Wizard](reference/mfc-class-wizard.md), the wizard adds an empty message map to the class. Use the wizard to map any Windows messages or commands you want your class to handle.

See [Mapping Windows Messages to Your Dialog Class](mapping-windows-messages-to-your-class.md) for more information.
