# Debugging Support Classes

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

MFC provides the following classes to help you debug dynamic memory allocation problems.

[CDumpContext](reference/cdumpcontext-class.md)<br/>
Provides a destination for diagnostic dumps.

[CMemoryState](reference/cmemorystate-structure.md)<br/>
Structure that provides snapshots of memory use. Also used to compare earlier and later memory snapshots.
