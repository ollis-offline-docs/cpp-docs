>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

The following classes are ready-to-use map classes.

[CMapPtrToPtr](../mfc/reference/cmapptrtoptr-class.md)<br/>
Uses **`void`** pointers as keys for finding other **`void`** pointers.

[CMapPtrToWord](../mfc/reference/cmapptrtoword-class.md)<br/>
Uses **`void`** pointers as keys for finding data of type **WORD**.

[CMapStringToOb](../mfc/reference/cmapstringtoob-class.md)<br/>
Uses `CString` objects as keys for finding `CObject` pointers.
