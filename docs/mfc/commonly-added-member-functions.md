# Commonly Added Member Functions

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

If your dialog box contains pushbuttons other than OK or Cancel, you need to write message-handler member functions in your dialog class to respond to the control-notification messages they generate. For an example, see the [Scribble](../overview/visual-cpp-samples.md) sample program. You can also handle control-notification messages from other controls in your dialog box.
