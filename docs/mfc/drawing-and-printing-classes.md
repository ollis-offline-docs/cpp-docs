# Drawing and Printing Classes

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

In Windows, all graphical output is drawn on a virtual drawing area called a device context (DC). MFC provides classes to encapsulate the various types of DCs, as well as encapsulations for Windows drawing tools such as bitmaps, brushes, palettes, and pens.
