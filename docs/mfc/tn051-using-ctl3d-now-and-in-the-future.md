# TN051: Using CTL3D Now and in the Future

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

This technical note, which previously discussed CTL3D and MFC, is now obsolete. The 3D effect for controls is automatically implemented by MFC.
