# Menus (MFC)

>[!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) library continues to be supported. However, we're no longer adding features or updating the documentation.

MFC supplies two elements to help you work with menus:

- Class [CMenu](reference/cmenu-class.md) for manipulating your program's menus at run time. Use the documentation for `CMenu` and the sample to learn how to use `CMenu` effectively.

- A mechanism for updating menus and toolbar buttons: enabling or disabling them on the fly to suit current program conditions.

Visual Studio also provides a [menu editor](../windows/menu-editor.md) for creating and editing your program's menu resources.
