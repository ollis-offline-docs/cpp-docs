# Troubleshoot Visual C++ Redistributable installation issues

This guide is for users experiencing issues installing Visual C++ Runtime components using the Visual Studio (VS) Installer or the Visual C++ Redistributable (VC Redist) installer.

If you experience any issues, start by ensuring you're installing the [latest version of the Visual C++ Redistributable](latest-supported-vc-redist.md).

## Collect failure logs

The first step to diagnose an issue with the Visual C++ Redistributable installer is to collect its failure logs.

1. Download the [Microsoft Visual Studio and .NET Log Collection Tool](<https://aka.ms/vscollect>).
1. Run `Collect.exe`.
1. Extract the contents of `%TEMP%/vscollect.zip`.

Once you extract `vscollect.zip`, the VC Redist logs are located inside the `Temp` folder. The relevant log files are prefixed with the pattern `dd_vcredist_<arch>_yyyyMMddHHmmss`.

Search the VC Redist logs for terms like "Error", "Failed", or "System Error" and consult the [Common Errors](#common-errors-at-a-glance) to identify the issue.

### Other log locations

The VC Redist installer is often executed as a prerequisite of other products. In such cases, the installation log might be found in a different path.

For example, [Configuration Manager](/intune/configmgr/core/understand/introduction) upgrades VC Redist as part of its own upgrade process by running `vcredist_x64.exe` with the `/l` option that overrides the default log location.

In such cases, the path to the logs can be found by reading that product's own logs:

**Example: Configuration Manager logs**

`<ConfigMgr_Installation_Directory>\Logs\cmupdate.log`

```log
10-31-2025 17:40:06.421    CONFIGURATION_MANAGER_UPDATE    67368 (0x10728)    [Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64)] with older version 14.28.29914 is installed. it needs to upgraded.

## General troubleshooting steps when using the Visual C++ Redistributable installer

This section describes general troubleshooting methods you can try to resolve issues with the VC Redist installer.

### Disable antivirus software temporarily

Antivirus software often blocks installation of VC Redist components.

1. Turn off Windows Defender real-time protection.
1. Disable any corporate endpoint protection temporarily (Symantec, McAfee, etc.).
1. Retry the installation.
1. Reenable any disabled protection software.

> [!WARNING]
> Re-enable any disabled protection software after completing these steps.


### Run the Visual C++ Redistributable installer as administrator

File-access failures are heavily correlated with insufficient permissions.

1. Right-click the VC Redist installer and select **Run as Administrator**.
1. Retry the installation.

### Check for Windows updates

On rare occasions, outdated system components can cause installation issues.

1. Go to Windows Update and install all pending updates.
2. Reboot your PC.
3. Retry the installation.

## General troubleshooting steps when using Visual Studio Installer

### Manually install Visual C++ Redistributable

> [!NOTE]
> The VS Installer might prompt for a reboot when VC Redist is installed separately.

1. Download the [latest VC Redist installer](latest-supported-vc-redist.md).
1. Run the VC Redist installer.
1. Retry the Visual Studio Installer.

If the manual installation fails, follow the [general troubleshooting steps for the standalone VC Redist installer](#general-troubleshooting-steps-when-using-the-visual-c-redistributable-installer).

### Clear the Visual Studio Installer cache

1. Open `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Packages`.
1. Delete all files inside the folder to force the Visual Studio Installer to regenerate them.
1. Retry the Visual Studio Installer.

### Repair the Visual Studio Installer

1. Open the **Settings** app.
1. Search for **Installed Apps** using the search bar at the top of the window.
1. Search for **Visual Studio Installer**.
1. Click on the "**...**" button and select **Modify**.
1. Select the option to **Repair** the Visual Studio Installer.
1. Retry the VS installation.

### Delete the Visual Studio Installer folder

> [!WARNING]
> This method requires that you have the Visual Studio Installer Setup downloaded (VisualStudioSetup.exe).
> You can download the Visual Studio Installer Setup from <https://my.visualstudio.com>.

This method helps in case the installer metadata is corrupted, deleting the installer folder forces the Visual Studio Installer to regenerate it.

1. Download `VisualStudioSetup.exe` from <https://my.visualstudio.com>.
1. Delete the folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer`, you might be prompted to run this operation as administrator.
1. Run `VisualStudioSetup.exe`.

## Common issues

### Common errors at a glance

* [Generic installation failure (return code 1603)](#generic-installation-failure)
* [Access denied (return code 5)](#access-denied)
* [File is locked (return code 32)](#file-is-locked)
* [Corrupt or invliad installer package (return code 1620)](#corrupt-or-invalid-installer-package)
* [Older version can't be removed (return code 1714)](#older-version-cant-be-removed)

### Generic installation failure

Return code 1603 indicates a generic installation failure produced by the Windows Installer during the installation of the Visual C++ Runtime components.

Because many factors can produce a 1603 code, the code by itself doesn't provide enough information to diagnose the cause of the issue.
Often, the log files produced by the VC Redist installer contain relevant information that might lead to a solution or workaround.

The [Common issues](#common-issues) section describes examples of how to diagnose common installation errors and steps that might resolve them.
If your issue isn't found here, then follow the instructions to [report an issue in the Visual C++ Redistributable installer](#report-a-visual-c-redistributable-installation-problem).

### Access denied

Installation fails with error code 5. This error code typically indicates a permissions issue; specifically, an access denied issue.

**Steps to resolve**

1. Disable antivirus, group policies, and firewalls temporarily.
1. Run the VC Redist installer.
1. Re-enable any disabled protection software.

If the installation fails, try to run the VC Redist installer as administrator.

### File is locked

Installation fails with error code 32. Files in use by another process, interference from antivirus software, group policies, or corrupted files are common causes.

**Steps to resolve**

1. Close any running software in your PC.
1. Try the methods in [General troubleshooting steps](#general-troubleshooting-steps-when-using-the-visual-c-redistributable-installer).

If the installation fails, try to restart your PC to release any locked files.

### Corrupt or invalid installer package

Installation fails with error code 1620. This error code indicates that a Windows Installer package (MSI) couldn't be opened, likely due to corruption or invalid files.

The presence of these error messages indicates a corrupted cache.

- Error code 1620: indicates that the Windows Installer package couldn't be opened.
- Error code 0x80091007: several payloads failed verification due to hash mismatches.
- Error code 0x80070654: occurs when an MSI package fails to execute.

**Steps to resolve**

Try the steps in the [General troubleshooting steps when using Visual Studio Installer](#general-troubleshooting-steps-when-using-visual-studio-installer).

### Older version can't be removed

Installation fails with the error code 1714. This error code indicates a corrupted Windows Installer cache that results in failure to remove a previous version of VC Redist.

The presence of these error messages indicates a corrupted cache.

In `dd_vcredist_<arch>_<timestamp>.log`

```log
Error 0x80070003: Failed to get size of pseudo bundle: C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\{43d1ce82-6f55-4860-a938-20e5deb28b98}\VC_redist.x64.exe

```

**Steps to resolve**

From the log files, take note of the VC Redist version causing the issue.

Method 1: Use the Windows Installer.

1. Try using the Windows Installer to manually remove the old VC Redist version. If prompted, let the Windows Installer Troubleshooter attempt to fix the issue.
1. Retry the installation.

Method 2: Manually remove the old version.

1. Download the VC Redist installer for the old version. Follow the [steps to download and old version of the VC Redist installer](#old-vcredist-versions)
1. Run the installer to uninstall the old VC Redist.
1. Retry the installation.
