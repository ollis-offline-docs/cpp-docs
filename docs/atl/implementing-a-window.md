# Implementing a Window

[!INCLUDE[product-lifecycle-status](includes/lifecycle-note.md)]

Class [CWindowImpl](../atl/reference/cwindowimpl-class.md) allows you to implement a window and handle its messages. Message handing in ATL is based on a message map. This section explains:

- How to [add a message handler](../atl/adding-an-atl-message-handler.md) to a control.

- What [message maps](../atl/message-maps-atl.md) are and how to use them.

- The syntax for [message handler functions](../atl/message-handler-functions.md).

- How to [implement a window with CWindowImpl](../atl/implementing-a-window-with-cwindowimpl.md).
