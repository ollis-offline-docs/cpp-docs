# Data Transfer Classes

[!INCLUDE[product-lifecycle-status](includes/lifecycle-note.md)]

The following classes support various types of data transfer:

- [IDataObjectImpl](../atl/reference/idataobjectimpl-class.md) Supports Uniform Data Transfer by using standard formats to retrieve and set data. Handles data change notifications by managing connections to advise sinks.

- [CBindStatusCallback](../atl/reference/cbindstatuscallback-class.md) Allows an asynchronous moniker to send and receive information about the asynchronous data transfer to and from your object.
